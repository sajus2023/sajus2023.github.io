# Global Warming - Causes and Impact

## About the Visualization

## Messaging
The narrative visualization aims to convey the message that there is proof of global warming and that we can identify the causes and impact of global warming from the data already available. The targeted viewers of this visualization are the skeptics, and all who wants to understand the proof, causes and impact of climate change - this visualization narrates it using available data on earth's suface temperature, sea level, CO2 concentration and the frequency of natural disasters.

## Narrative Structure
Interactive slide-show - The Interactive Slideshow structure follows a typical slideshow format, but incorporates interaction mid-narrative within the confines of each slide. All scenes with charts in this visualization interacts with the viewer through tooltips and filters.

[Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf) mentions narrative as "The Oxford English Dictionary defines narrative as “an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.” Central to this definition is the notion of a chain of  causally related events. Stories of this form often have a beginning, middle, and end [3, 24]: an introduction to the situation, a series of events often involving tension or conflict, and a resolution."

This narration has the beginning, middle and end as following:
Proof -> Cause -> Impact.

The approach is to provide a visualization of the tremendous increase in the earth's surface temperature since the 1980's as the proof of global warming followed by visualizing the increase in CO2 concentration in the earth atmosphere to deduce the obvious - increased CO2 concentration is the major cause of global warming. This is followed by visualizing two major impacts of global warming - increase in mean sea levels and increase in the frequency of natural disasters.

### Why use interactive slide-show?
1. Helps understand complex data:
In this narration, multiple datasets which when analyzed on their own does not help understand the bigger picture and how they are all related. Interacitve slide-show helps understand complex data by allowing the author to walk the viewer through the various dimensions and meaning of the data and later allowing a reader-driven exploration to understand the data in-depth.
2. Helps communicate the intended message:
Due to the complexity of the data and the topic, it is easy for the reader to get lost in the data. Narrative slide-show helps the narrator to focus on the message and represent the data before the user interact with the visualization. 
3. User can re-visit scenes if needed: User can revisit scenes and comprehend the details before moving on to the next scenes
4. Author can set boundaries between scenes: As seen in this visualization, boundaries are established between the proof, cause and impact visualizations.

## Visual Structure
A common theme is applied to all scenes there by avoiding distractions - the theme includes a background image, colors and font on the scenes. Important information is depecited using colors that are visually appeasing.

The most important visual structures are the following:
1. Splash screen: Slide 1 indicates the topic of the narration clearly. Slide 2 indicates that the narration is derived from renowned datasets.
2. Consistent visual platform: All scenes adhere to the same theme (background image, color scheme, widgets, placements, font, font sizes)
3. Progress bar: The progress bar at the bottom clearly represents where the viewer is currently in this narration

## Scenes
The scenes are ordered based on the story - proof, causes and effects of global warming. The scenes transition from indicating the usage of renowned datasets, proof of global warming following by its causes and effects.

Scene 1: Splash screen indicating subject and objective of the narration
Scene 2: Establishes that the narration is derived from renowned datasets
Scene 3: Proves global warming is not a myth using the change in earth's surface temperature which has increased more than 2 times since 1980s
Scene 4: Identified increase in CO2 concentration as a major cause of global warming
Scene 5: Indicates that the mean sea level increase as one of the impact of global warming
Scene 6: Indicates that the increase in the frequency of natural disasters is another impact of global warming

## Annotations
Interesting trends are annotated in the scenes. Template applied to make the scenes consistent for easier interaction.

## Parameters
The viewer can apply filtering on various countries to see the impact of the global warming by selecting countries in scene 6.

## Triggers
The viewer can apply filtering and can use mouse to show tooltips with details on demand. Visual and textual cues are provided to the viewer.
